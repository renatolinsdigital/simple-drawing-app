# Simple Drawing App

A drawing application featuring core functionalities such as brush strokes, undo (Ctrl+Z), adjustable color and brush size, and export options. The drawing functionality relies on [perfect-freehand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/perfect-freehand) module. This application is a work in progress and is not yet considered a final product. It serves as both a coding practice project and a portfolio piece. Additional features may be implemented in the future to elevate it into a fully functional drawing application.
